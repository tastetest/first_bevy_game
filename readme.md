# TODO 
1. Implement Physics engine, Bevy Rapier 2d. 
* I have added a simple player, with a collider, and a ball with a rigidy body.
* My problem is, that as long as an entity has a rigid body, gravity is applied to them
* obviously, in my game, a top down game, it doesn't need to have gravity. I want to be
* able to make my player collide with walls. How do i do that?
2. Implement Bullets for the player to fire
    - when pressing space, the player will fire bullets, at a certain rate. they will keep moving (until colliding with an object)
    - the bullet should also face whatever direction the player is facing
3. add in enemy AI
4. add in player health, with limited amount of lives.
