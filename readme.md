# TODO 

1. Implement Physics engine, Bevy Rapier 2d.****** DONE 
2. Implement Bullets for the player to fire
    - when pressing space, the player will fire bullets, at a certain rate. they will keep moving (until colliding with an object)
    - the bullet should also face whatever direction the player is facing
3. add in enemy AI
4. add in player health, with limited amount of lives.


5. implement multiplayer:
-- maybe use tokio or other multiplayer libraries?
-- or instead of tokio, use naia which is built for bevy multiplayer instead of just async calls
